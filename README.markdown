##A Toolset For Working With ComputerCraft Lua-Based Computers

### What th' Hell is this?

Working with the Lua-flavoured drones in [*MineCraft*'s *ComputerCraft* mod](http://www.computercraft.info/) is a lot of fun, but it can also be hideous amounts of work. The built-in programs are great, but sometimes you need a little more horsepower, bigger tools, or more functions.

Enter *SquidOS*.

We do the heavy lifting so you don't have to. Want to maneuver your drone around without entering Lua directly? We can do that. Want to broadcast status messages to the local rednet nodes with a single command? We can do that. Want to dig up only the obsidian in a contiguous area underneath your bot? We can do that.

And you can help.

*SquidOS* has [a temporary pseudo-roadmap online in the form of part of a *MindMap*,](http://www.mindmeister.com/258123253/minecraft) but that's not the _only_ source of input. You can help! *SquidOS* is a publically hosted project, one which you can be a part of. 

### How can I help?

[*SquidOS* is publically accessible on *gitHub*.](https://github.com/SquidLord/SquidOS) That means you can pull off a working copy, fiddle code, then offer it back up to us to integrate with the master code base. We like that sort of thing. It makes the amount we have to code ourselves much less.

What, you don't have that kind of time? That's OK. *gitHub* has a built in issue tracker. See a bug? Log a bug. We even take suggestions ... sparingly.

### What next?

Get to crafting!
